So, I just made a commit and the breakdown is,

+ +301 Lines of Code/Comments
+ +182 Lines of documentation
+ +3344 Lines of Tests (!!!)

+ -214 Lines of Code/Comments (mostly comments)
+ -6 Lines of Tests

https://github.com/AnyhowStep/tsql/commit/5fde1036dff5eb103287497523e49c4306a120a1

So, I roughly needed 1 line of documentation for every 2 LoC added
And 10 lines of testing for every LoC added
